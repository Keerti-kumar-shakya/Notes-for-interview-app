    question: `What is the difference between reactive and adaptive designs?`,
    topic: 'Reactive Design vs Adaptive Design', 
    studyMaterial: `
    Reactive Design: Typically refers to designs that respond to changes in the viewport size using CSS media queries. It often adjusts layout and content based on specific screen sizes or resolutions, creating a fixed set of rules for different breakpoints.
................................................................................................................................................................................
Adaptive Design: Involves creating different layouts or designs specifically tailored for various devices or screen sizes. Rather than just changing the layout based on screen size, adaptive design provides a set of predefined layouts for specific devices or contexts, often involving more tailored adjustments.

In short, reactive design adjusts within a range of sizes, while adaptive design uses distinct layouts for specific sizes.

    question: `Tell the difference between inline and inline block?`,
    topic: 'inline & inline block', 
    studyMaterial: `In CSS, the difference between inline and inline-block is:

    inline: Elements are laid out in a row and only take up as much width as their content. They do not respect width or height properties and do not start on a new line.........................................................................................................................................................................................................................
    
    inline-block: Elements are also laid out in a row like inline, but they respect width and height properties. They do start on a new line if there isn't enough space on the current line, but they do not break the flow like block elements.
    ....................................................................
    In summary, inline elements ignore width/height and stay in-line, while inline-block elements respect width/height and stay in-line as well.`,
